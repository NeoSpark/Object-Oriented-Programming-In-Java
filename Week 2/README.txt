In this assignment you will...
 Set-up the Eclipse IDE with the UCSDUnfoldingMap libraries
 Create and organize new files (projects, packages, classes) in Eclipse
 Compile and run a program in Eclipse
 Use documentation to add code to a program

This is your first programming assignment of the course. All the other assignments will build on this
one as you create your project.
Before you can start programming your project, you need to set up your environment (IDE). Detailed
setup instructions are linked here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-
java/supplement/zqSRy/setting-up-java-eclipse-and-unfolding-maps. You’ll need an internet
connection for that part.
If you've already got eclipse and Java set up and you just need the UnfoldingMaps library, you can
find the starter code linked from the set up guide above.
